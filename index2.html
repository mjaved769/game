            The computer picks a sequence of colors. The number of colors is the code length.

        </li>
        <li>
            The objective of the game is to guess the exact positions of the colors in the computer's sequence.
        </li>
        <li>By default, a color can be used only once in a code sequence. If you start a new game with the 'Allow
            duplicates' checked, then any color can be used any number of times in the code sequence.
        </li>

        <li> After filling a line with your guesses and clicking on the 'Check' button, the computer responses with the
            result of your guess.
        </li>
        <li>For each color in your guess that is in the correct color and correct position in the code sequence, the
            computer display a small red color on the right side of the current guess.
        </li>
        <li>For each color in your guess that is in the correct color but is NOT in the correct position in the code
            sequence, the computer display a small white color on the right side of the current guess.
        </li>
        <li>For each color in your guess that is not the correct, the computer displays a small black color on the right
            side of the guess
        </li>
        <li>You win the game when you manage to guess all the colors in the code sequence and when they all in the right
            position.
        </li>

    <h1 style="padding-left: 180px;">How to play the game</h1>

        <li>Start a new game by clicking on the 'Start Game' button. If you wish to change the default game parameters,
            you may change the 'Allow duplicates' field before clicking on the 'Start Game' button.
        </li>
        <li>To start filling a line, you must first select a color at the bottom of the table by clicking on it. After
            selecting a color you can just put it in the current guess line above by clicking on the desired position.
        </li>
        <li>After filling a whole line, you can still change your selection before asking the computer to respond to
            your guess. When you're satisfied with your guess, just click on the 'Check' button and get the computer
            response.
        </li>
        <li>You have 10 attempts to guess the code sequence. Good Luck!
        </li>
